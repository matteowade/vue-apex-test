Please use the comment box below.": "My son has been with the program and this is his 3rd year but it seems as though it's not to organized this year. Not because if coaches or administrators it seems as though parents signed up there children and they are not bringing them so all of the teams are uneven. It is sad because there is a lot of kids who could not sign up because it was full and it is being abused by parents who don't take it seriously. I love this program for my son. Hopefully next year is better.",

I appreciate the hard work by the volunteers to keep the program moving, and I understand the concept of Team Work, but this year has been a little more difficult with participation from the players. Participants that show up to every practice, and every game and complete the weekly goals to be eligible for the prizes, are dinged by having team members that don't show or don't complete the goals. I wish the players who fully participate could be recognized for their hardwork!",

Now I can clearly see the disadvantage of just having very few volunteers. I am thankful for parents/ families who take time to bring their kids but there could have been WAY MORE advantages for the kids if they could alot more time and effort to practice the kids than just watch them or just drop them off. Our team is lucky to have just the right amount of members. Everyone seems to enjoy every practice and game. And they're acquiring more friends :)",

I did not receive updated information on teams but a parent reached out and we just initiated to make our own practice times. People who are in their 1st yr on the program needs more guidance on what to do. Without the assistance of a parent who previously participated in the program I would have been lost. I have taken the initiative to be the coach of our team. And everyone involved have gotten the chance to enjoy the game of baseball.",
